This is a tool I built for the Epsilon Kappa chapter of Tau Beta Sigma and the
Psi chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi. In our organizations, we get a Big Brother and
Big Sister from each organization. This tool allows people to find connections
to other members through our extended family trees.

I implemented the search as an iterative deepening search, so that it would
always find the shortest connection between two members while also being
time and space efficient.
